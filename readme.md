# Saunf

Saunf is a software project management tool, which allows doing
collaborative project management in plain text.

Not everyone is a plain-text fan, so to keep the spirit of collaboration
alive, saunf has keeping different tools in sync as its core idea. You
can create your entire project as a single org file, and saunf will take
care of keeping things in sync with e.g github-issues for creating
issues for user stories and readme.md to maintain a good front-facing
documentation.

## Features

### Documentation management

Define the structure of your readme file, and keep it in sync with your
main project file.

### User Story management

Define user stories in your project file, and keep them in sync with
github issues.
